I have realized a generative AI model that acts like an expert of Formula 1, in particular it is able to answer questions on the topic by checking for information on a given knowledge base.  It is, in facts, a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) model, so it enables a <dynamic prompting> approach since it can retrieve info from a knowledge base.
